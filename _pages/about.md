- Hello, I am Shenglong, my English name is **James**.
- I am currently a first year CS PhD Student at Georgia Tech in Computer Seurity.
- I got my B.S. in CS from City University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Cong Wang.
- Before joining Georgia Tech, I have worked as a research intern at UCSB SecLab with Prof Christopher Kruegel and Prof. Giovanni Vigna.

## Research Interest

- I am interested in everything related to computer security.
- Currently, my research interests include but are not limited to software security and system security. I am also interested in applying machine learning method in security area.
- My detailed research experience can be seen in my [cv](files/cv.pdf).
